### All our projects are made with zero budget so with pure love and dedication for our mission: 
* open source & transparency, 
* inclusiveness, 
* digital literacy and 
* open organization. 

It is not easy, but we don’t want to waste our time chasing funding and investors or clients, but instead co-create the world we want to live in. And we believe right people and opportunities will come from that and from the people that share the mindset and want to join us.
